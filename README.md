# restaurant-page

## BurgerHouse restaurant page that was build to apply webpack skills. It contains 3 modules - Home, Menu and About section.

This project was easier than the previous one but also there was a moment when I wanted to throw my keyboard onto the wall :D. It was when I was setting my webpack to work properly and every package that I wanted. It was a moment when I said, okay, I need to end this for today. I will do it in the next day. I did it, without frustration I became calm and after that it took me 3 hours to make this not beautiful, but working site. Maybe I will come back to it and make it look more appealing, but for me the most important thing is that it works correctly and I put my webpacks skills into practice.
I'm looking forward to another challanges and I'm happpy that I'm in this place.
